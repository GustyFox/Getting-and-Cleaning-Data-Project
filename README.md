## The Script
Our Script for this project perform analisys on " Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors".
Our data is fully described here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The general steps of teh script are the following:

1. Download, unzip and load source data into R
2. Merge the data sets of interest
3. Name the columns properly
   - Extrect only columns of interest
   - Calculates mean and standard deviation
4. Creates a Second Tidy Data Set  (MyTidySet)

The script is expected to generate a file with the average of each variable of the original dataset for each activity and each subject.
